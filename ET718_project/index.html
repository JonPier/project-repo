    <h2>ABOUT OZONE PARK</h2>
	  <p>

Ozone Park is a neighborhood located in the southwestern section of the borough of Queens, in New York City, New York, United States. It is located next to the Aqueduct Racetrack in South Ozone Park, a popular spot for Thoroughbred racing. The neighborhood was known for its large Italian-American population. Over the years, it has become a very diverse community.

  Events like the construction of  factories, houses, churches and transportation systems changed the entire landscape of the neighborhood. These events, specially the development of the Fulton Street Line, made the population of the neighborhood grow.  Nowdays the expansion of Ozone Park  also includes Tudor village.

  In the 21st century, the name "Ozone Park" doesn't ring like it used to. With climate change and concerns about the earth's ozone layer occupying the global headlines, it's hard to imagine a neighborhood named for ozone. When the area was developed in the 1880s, the name "Ozone Park" was selected to lure residents with the thoughts of ocean breezes. Ozone meant pure air, not sullied air. At the time, the area was considered the countryside, compared to Manhattan and Brooklyn. A LIRR station (long gone) helped attract residents.
